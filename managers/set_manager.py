    The Set Manager is responsible for managing sets of objects from a regular manager.
    It provides iteration, length, indexing, and next functionality based on the favorite sets

    Attributes:
        regular_manager (RegularManager): The regular manager containing the objects.

    Methods:
        __iter__(): Returns an iterator that iterates over the objects in the favorite sets.
        __len__(): Returns the total length of all favorite sets combined.
        __getitem__(index): Returns the item at the specified index in the combined favorite sets.
        __next__(): Raises a StopIteration exception.
